## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run **AwesomeCLI**, you need the following:

- A C++ inline compiler, here we will use G++ made by the GNU collection. Wich is not the best idea due to its slows compile times.
- Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)
- C++17-compatible compiler

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AwesomeCLI.git
cd AwesomeCLI
```

2. Compile and run.
```bash
   g++ main.cpp structure/structure.cpp -o awesome-cli
   required: sudo ./awesome-cli --help
   ```
   
3. Feel free to edit and use it for your personal use or developing apps with this main structure that will reserve you a lot of time.
